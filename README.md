Source code for my boilerplate node web app starter template, consisting of:

* express.js
* ejs
* bootstrap
* mongoose
* passport.js
* connect-flash
* connect-validator
* express-validator
* nodemailer

Basic signup and login is configured to run out of the box.

MongoStore is used for session persistance.

So you can start working on the "real-stuff" :)

For running the application :
* `npm install`
* `npm start`

TODO:

* User roles/groups
* Basic user and group administration
